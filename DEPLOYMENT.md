## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Regularly rotate API keys

### Database Security
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Review and test all RLS policies
- Use the service role key only for server-side operations

### API Rate Limits
- Monitor API usage for all services
- Implement proper error handling for rate limits
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Analytics

### Error Monitoring
Consider adding error monitoring services:
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking
- [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/) for session replay
- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) for performance monitoring

### Database Monitoring
- Monitor Supabase usage and performance
- Set up alerts for high usage or errors
- Regular database backups

### API Monitoring
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for API failures
- Track usage against rate limits

## ðŸš€ Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Domain Configuration
- Set up custom domain if desired
- Configure SSL certificate (usually automatic)
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable

### 2. Base MiniApp Registration
- Register your app with Base if required
- Update any Base-specific configurations
- Test MiniKit integration in production

### 3. Farcaster Integration

- Optimize images and assets as needed

### 5. SEO and Social
- Add proper meta tags
- Configure Open Graph images
- Set up social media sharing

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions (Optional)
Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
   - Check linting errors: `npm run lint`
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Check variable names match exactly
   - Verify API keys are valid

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys
   - Check RLS policies aren't blocking access
   - Ensure database schema is up to date

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Neynar API key is valid
   - Check Farcaster integration setup
   - Ensure Privy configuration is correct

5. **API Rate Limits**
   - Monitor API usage
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Consider upgrading API plans if needed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the application logs in your deployment platform
2. Review the browser console for client-side errors
3. Check Supabase logs for database issues
4. Verify all API services are operational

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

As your application grows, consider:

- **Database**: Upgrade Supabase plan for more connections and storage
- **API Limits**: Monitor and upgrade API service plans as needed
- **CDN**: Use Vercel's CDN or add Cloudflare for better performance
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Consider multiple deployment regions
