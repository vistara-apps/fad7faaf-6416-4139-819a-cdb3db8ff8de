# X402 Payment Flow Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the x402 payment flow in the EduConnect Base Mini App.

## Overview

The x402 payment flow has been successfully integrated into the EduConnect app, enabling secure USDC payments on the Base network. The implementation uses wagmi for wallet interactions and x402-axios for payment processing.

## Key Components

### 1. PaymentFlow Component (`components/features/PaymentFlow.tsx`)

The main payment component that handles the complete x402 flow:

- **Wallet Integration**: Uses wagmi `useWalletClient`, `useAccount`, and `useBalance` hooks
- **USDC Support**: Configured for USDC token on Base (address: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`)
- **Payment States**: Manages idle, preparing, confirming, success, and error states
- **Balance Validation**: Checks user's USDC balance before payment
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Waits for on-chain confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. PaymentDemo Component (`components/features/PaymentDemo.tsx`)

A demonstration interface showcasing various payment options:

- **Multiple Payment Options**: Tutoring sessions, study groups, consultations, premium features
- **Interactive UI**: Card-based selection with feature lists and pricing
- **Payment Tracking**: Tracks completed payments and prevents duplicate payments
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting the demo state

### 3. X402 Test Utilities (`lib/x402-test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing utilities for the x402 integration:

- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete payment flow testing
- **Balance Validation**: USDC balance checking utilities
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensures proper setup
- **Mock Testing**: Simulates payment flows for development

## Implementation Details

### Payment Flow Steps

1. **Wallet Connection**: User connects their wallet via OnchainKit
2. **Payment Selection**: User selects a payment option from the demo interface
3. **Balance Check**: System validates sufficient USDC balance
4. **Payment Request**: Creates x402 payment request with metadata
5. **Transaction Execution**: Uses wagmi to send the transaction
6. **Confirmation**: Waits for transaction confirmation on Base
7. **Verification**: Verifies payment with x402 service
8. **Success Handling**: Updates UI and provides transaction link

### Key Features

- ✅ **USDC on Base**: Native support for USDC payments on Base network
- ✅ **Wagmi Integration**: Seamless wallet client integration
- ✅ **Balance Validation**: Real-time USDC balance checking
- ✅ **Transaction Confirmation**: Waits for on-chain confirmation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and messages
- ✅ **Transaction Links**: Direct links to BaseScan for verification
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly payment interface
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing utilities

### Configuration

The implementation uses the following configuration:

```typescript
// USDC contract address on Base
const USDC_ADDRESS = '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913';

// X402 client configuration
const x402Client = createX402Client({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://api.educonnect.app',
  chainId: base.id,
  tokenAddress: USDC_ADDRESS,
});
```

## Navigation Integration

The payment demo has been integrated into the main app navigation:

- Added "Payments" tab to the navigation bar
- Updated navigation icons to include CreditCard icon
- Integrated payment demo into the main app routing

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the wallet connection in the header
2. **Navigate to Payments**: Click the "Payments" tab in navigation
3. **Select Payment Option**: Choose from available payment options
4. **Review Details**: Check payment amount and features
5. **Execute Payment**: Click "Pay with USDC" button
6. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve transaction in wallet
7. **Verify Success**: Check for success message and transaction link

### Automated Testing

Use the test utilities in `lib/x402-test.ts`:

```typescript
import { runAllTests } from '@/lib/x402-test';

// Run comprehensive tests
await runAllTests('0x...userAddress');
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_onchainkit_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.educonnect.app
```

## Dependencies Added

- `x402-axios`: X402 payment protocol client
- Enhanced `@tanstack/react-query` configuration for better caching

## Security Considerations

- All payments are processed on-chain using USDC
- Transaction confirmation is required before marking payments as successful
- Balance validation prevents insufficient fund transactions
- Error handling prevents exposure of sensitive information
- All transactions are verifiable on BaseScan

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the payment system:

1. **Payment History**: Track and display user's payment history
2. **Recurring Payments**: Support for subscription-based payments
3. **Multi-Token Support**: Support for other ERC-20 tokens
4. **Payment Receipts**: Generate and store payment receipts
5. **Refund System**: Implement payment refund functionality
6. **Payment Analytics**: Track payment metrics and success rates

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Wallet Not Connected
- Ensure wallet is connected via the header wallet button
- Check that the wallet is on the Base network

### Insufficient Balance
- Verify USDC balance in wallet
- Ensure balance is sufficient for the payment amount plus gas fees

### Transaction Failed
- Check network connectivity
- Verify wallet has enough ETH for gas fees
- Ensure USDC contract is not paused

### X402 Service Issues
- Verify API endpoint configuration
- Check network connectivity to x402 service
- Review browser console for detailed error messages

## Conclusion

The x402 payment flow has been successfully implemented and integrated into the EduConnect Base Mini App. The implementation provides a secure, user-friendly payment experience with comprehensive error handling and testing capabilities.
